# Collaboration Network Analysis Plan
## Math Research Compass - Author Network Evolution Study

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Objective**: Analyze the evolution of collaboration networks in mathematical research topics over time using NetworkX graphs built from arXiv paper co-authorship data.

**Dataset**: 121,391 papers across 1,938 mathematical research topics (from your existing topic modeling analysis)

**Time Scope**: Quarterly analysis from 2020-2025 (21 quarters total)

## 📊 **Data Structure**

### **Input Data**: `data/cleaned/author_topic_networks.csv`
- **121,391 total papers**
- **1,938 unique topics** (Topic IDs: 0-1937)
- **Columns**:
  - `topic`: Research topic ID (0-1937)
  - `authors_parsed`: Nested list format: `[['LastName', 'FirstName', ''], ...]`
  - `year`, `quarter`: Time period information
  - `id`, `title`: Paper identifiers
  - `date`: Publication date

### **Sample Topic Statistics** (Topic 0):
- 2,207 total papers
- 1,760 collaboration papers (multi-author)
- 447 single-author papers
- Strong collaboration rate: 79.7%

---

## 🔬 **Analysis Methodology**

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
```python
def parse_authors(authors_str):
    """Convert '[['Last', 'First', ''], ...]' → ['First Last', ...]"""
```

**What it does**:
- Parse nested list format author strings
- Create standardized "First Last" names
- Filter out papers with <2 authors (no collaboration)

**Expected Output**: Clean author lists for network construction

### **Step 2: Quarterly Network Construction**
```python
def build_quarterly_networks(topic_papers):
    """Create NetworkX graphs for each quarter"""
```

**For each quarter (e.g., "2020-Q1", "2020-Q2", ...):**
1. **Nodes**: Authors who published in that quarter
2. **Edges**: Co-authorship relationships (author pairs on same paper)
3. **Edge Weights**: Number of joint papers between author pairs
4. **Node Attributes**: Number of papers per author in that quarter

**Network Properties**:
- **Graph Type**: Undirected graph (collaboration is symmetric)
- **Multi-edges**: Single edge with weight = number of joint papers
- **Self-loops**: None (authors don't collaborate with themselves)

### **Step 3: Network Metrics Calculation**
```python
def calculate_network_metrics(graph):
    """Compute standard network analysis metrics"""
```

**Metrics Computed**:
- **Size**: Number of nodes (authors), edges (collaborations)
- **Density**: Actual edges / possible edges
- **Components**: Number of disconnected subgraphs
- **Largest Component**: Size and fraction of total network
- **Clustering**: Average clustering coefficient
- **Centrality**: Degree, betweenness, closeness centrality measures

### **Step 4: Temporal Evolution Analysis**
```python
def analyze_temporal_trends(quarterly_networks, quarterly_metrics):
    """Track how networks change over time"""
```

**Evolution Tracking**:
- **Growth Patterns**: How network size changes quarterly
- **Density Evolution**: Network connectivity over time
- **Author Persistence**: Who appears across multiple quarters
- **Collaboration Stability**: Which partnerships persist

### **Step 5: Author & Collaboration Analysis**
```python
def analyze_authors_and_collaborations(overall_network):
    """Identify key researchers and partnerships"""
```

**Author Analysis**:
- **Productivity**: Papers per author
- **Connectivity**: Number of unique collaborators
- **Persistence**: Active quarters span
- **Centrality**: Network position importance

**Collaboration Analysis**:
- **Strength**: Number of joint papers per pair
- **Duration**: Quarters of active collaboration
- **Patterns**: One-time vs. repeat collaborations
