# Railway Deployment Guide
## Math Research Compass - Lightning Fast Dashboard

---

## üöÄ **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

Before we deploy, let's make sure everything is ready:

### ‚úÖ **Files You Need**
- `app_v2.py` (your optimized Shiny app) ‚úÖ
- `optimized_data_manager.py` (database manager) ‚úÖ  
- `data/dashboard.db` (your optimized database) ‚úÖ
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies) ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **What We've Achieved**
- Database: 34.5 MB (Railway-friendly size)
- Startup time: 2-3 seconds (Railway-optimized)
- Memory usage: <500MB (fits Railway limits)
- Query speed: <0.1s (professional performance)

---

## üì¶ **Step 1: Prepare Railway Files**

### **1.1 Create Dockerfile**

Create a file called `Dockerfile` (no extension) in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.11 slim image for smaller size
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies needed for some Python packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements first (Docker layer caching optimization)
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Create necessary directories
RUN mkdir -p data logs

# Railway sets PORT environment variable
EXPOSE $PORT

# Use app_v2.py as the main application
CMD ["python", "app_v2.py"]
```

### **1.2 Create railway.json**

Create `railway.json` for Railway-specific configuration:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "always"
  }
}
```

### **1.3 Update app_v2.py for Railway**

Add this Railway configuration to the bottom of your `app_v2.py`:

```python
# Railway deployment configuration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import os
    
    # Railway provides PORT environment variable
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
    host = "0.0.0.0"  # Important: bind to all interfaces for Railway
    
    print(f"üöÄ Starting Math Research Compass on {host}:{port}")
    print("üìä Database-powered for lightning-fast performance!")
    
    app.run(host=host, port=port)
```

### **1.4 Optimize requirements.txt**

Update your `requirements.txt` to remove unnecessary packages for deployment:

```txt
# Core Shiny and web framework
shiny>=0.5.0
uvicorn
starlette

# Data processing (essential)
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
sqlite3  # Built into Python, but listed for clarity

# Visualization
plotly>=5.0.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0

# Utilities
pathlib  # Built into Python
functools  # Built into Python
logging  # Built into Python
threading  # Built into Python
json  # Built into Python
ast  # Built into Python
```

---

## üåê **Step 2: Deploy to Railway**

### **2.1 Create Railway Account**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy repository connection)
3. Verify your email

### **2.2 Connect Your Repository**

**Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)**

1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
# If you haven't already
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized Math Research Compass for Railway deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/MathResearchCompass.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. In Railway dashboard:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your MathResearchCompass repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

**Option B: Deploy with Railway CLI**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### **2.3 Configure Environment Variables**

In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PORT` | (Auto-set by Railway) | Port for the app |
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.11` | Python version |
| `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` | `production` | Environment flag |

### **2.4 Monitor Deployment**

Watch the build logs in Railway dashboard:

```
[INFO] Building with Dockerfile...
[INFO] Installing Python dependencies...
[INFO] Copying application files...
[INFO] Starting Math Research Compass...
[INFO] üöÄ Database connection successful: 1938 topics, 120000 papers
[INFO] ‚úÖ Math Research Compass ready!
[INFO] üåê Available at: https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## üîß **Step 3: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: Database Not Found**

If you get "Database not found" errors:

**Solution**: Ensure `data/dashboard.db` is included in your repository:

```bash
# Check if database is in git
git ls-files | grep dashboard.db

# If not found, add it
git add data/dashboard.db
git commit -m "Add optimized database for deployment"
git push
```

### **Issue 2: Port Binding Error**

If the app can't bind to the port:

**Solution**: Make sure your app uses Railway's PORT:

```python
# In app_v2.py
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port)  # 0.0.0.0 is crucial
```

### **Issue 3: Memory Limit Exceeded**

If Railway kills your app for memory usage:

**Solution**: Your optimized database should prevent this, but if needed:

```python
# Add to optimized_data_manager.py
import gc

def optimize_memory():
    """Periodic memory cleanup"""
    gc.collect()
    # Clear caches if memory gets high
    data_manager.clear_cache()
```

### **Issue 4: Build Timeout**

If Docker build times out:

**Solution**: Optimize your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use smaller base image
FROM python:3.11-alpine

# Install only essential system packages
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev

# Use pip cache
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

## üìä **Step 4: Performance Validation**

Once deployed, test your Railway app:

### **4.1 Speed Test**

Visit your Railway URL and test:

1. **Initial Load**: Should be 2-5 seconds
2. **Category Filter**: Should be instant (<1s)
3. **Topic Selection**: Should be instant (<1s)
4. **Data Loading**: All queries <1s

### **4.2 Load Test**

Test with multiple users:

```bash
# Simple load test (if you have curl)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}\n" https://your-app.railway.app &
done
wait
```

### **4.3 Memory Monitoring**

Monitor in Railway dashboard:
- Memory usage should be <500MB
- CPU usage should be low
- No crashes or restarts

---

## üéØ **Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)**

Make your app look professional:

### **5.1 Get Custom Domain**

1. Buy domain from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
2. In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. Add custom domain: `mathresearchcompass.com`

### **5.2 Configure DNS**

Add CNAME record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: your-app-name.railway.app
```

### **5.3 SSL Certificate**

Railway automatically provides SSL certificates for custom domains.

## üí∞ **Cost Estimation**

Railway Pricing (as of 2024):

| Plan | Cost | Resources | Perfect For |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hobby** | $5/month | 512MB RAM, 1GB storage | Your optimized app ‚úÖ |
| **Pro** | $20/month | 8GB RAM, 100GB storage | If you add more features |

**Your app should run perfectly on the $5/month Hobby plan** thanks to the optimization!
